## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is my belief that entertainment consumption patterns reflect how people manage their time, stress, and preferences during their current life stages. Analyzing my entertainment data from Letterboxd, TV Time, Goodreads, and Instagram will offer an opportunity to discover insights about my behavior during distinct phases of my life: working full-time, studying for university entrance exams while working, and being a full-time university student. By exploring how entertainment habits change based on different levels of busyness, this project aims to highlight the relationship between time constraints and entertainment activities.

## Main Research Questions and Hypotheses

**1. Content Type Preferences**

- **Research Question:** How do my preferences for movies and social media content vary across different life stages?  
	- **Hypothesis:** During busier life phases (exam preparation), I will consume shorter content (Instagram posts) more frequently, while longer content (movies) will be consumed during less busy periods (university and full-time work).  

- **Research Question:** Is there a shift towards shorter or more easily consumable content during busier periods?  
	- **Hypothesis:** The average duration of entertainment content consumed will decrease during high-stress periods (exam preparation) compared to low-stress periods (university and full-time work).  

**2. Stress Correlation**  

- **Research Question:** How does Instagram usage correlate with periods of high stress, such as exam preparations?  
	- **Hypothesis:** Instagram usage will increase significantly during periods of high stress.  

## Data Source

Entertainment data is exported directly from Letterboxd and Instagram as a personal data request.

The data will focus on the following variables:

- **Letterboxd:** Movie titles, genres, watch dates, duration.  
- **Instagram:** Post engagement.  

## Planned Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends, platform usage, and preferences.  
- **Web Scraping:** Scrape additional movie information from Letterboxd.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Investigate the hypotheses listed above using techniques such as Mann-Whitney U test.  

## Expected Outcomes

- Insights into how time constraints and stress affect entertainment choices.  
- Identification of patterns in content consumption during different life stages.  
- Reflection on personal habits and potential suggestions for more balanced entertainment consumption.
