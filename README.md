## Introduction

I am Nur İdil Müftüoğlu (34292) and this is my term project for DSA 210 - Introduction to Data Science course. 

The following information will be updated as the project progresses.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is my belief that entertainment consumption patterns reflect how people manage their time, stress, and preferences during their current life stages. Analyzing my entertainment data from Letterboxd, TV Time, Goodreads, and Instagram will offer an opportunity to discover insights about my behavior during distinct phases of my life: working full-time, studying for university entrance exams while working, and being a full-time university student. By exploring how entertainment habits change based on different levels of busyness, this project aims to highlight the relationship between time constraints and entertainment activities.

## Main Research Questions and Hypotheses

**1. Content Type Preferences**

- **Research Question:** How do my preferences for books, movies, TV shows, and social media content vary across different life stages?  
	- **Hypothesis:** During busier life phases (full-time work or study), I will consume shorter content (e.g., TV episodes, Instagram posts) more frequently, while longer content (e.g., books, movies) will be consumed during less busy periods.  

- **Research Question:** Is there a shift towards shorter or more easily consumable content during busier periods?  
	- **Hypothesis:** The average duration of entertainment content consumed will decrease during high-stress periods (e.g., full-time work) compared to low-stress periods (e.g., university holidays).  

**2. Volume and Frequency**  

- **Research Question:** How does the overall volume of entertainment consumed change between full-time work and full-time university?  
	- **Hypothesis:** The total volume of entertainment consumed (e.g., hours spent, items watched/read) will be higher during the university phase compared to the full-time work phase due to a more flexible schedule.  

- **Research Question:** Are there notable patterns in entertainment frequency across weekdays versus weekends in different phases?  
	- **Hypothesis:** Entertainment consumption will be more concentrated on weekends during the full-time work phase but spread more evenly across weekdays and weekends during the university phase.  

**3. Platform Preferences** 

- **Research Question:** Which platforms (Letterboxd, TV Time, Goodreads, Instagram) are used most during each life stage, and why?  
	- **Hypothesis:** Instagram and TV Time will dominate during busier periods (e.g., work), while Goodreads and Letterboxd will be used more during less busy phases (e.g., university holidays).  

- **Research Question:** Do certain platforms dominate during high-stress periods compared to low-stress times?  
	- **Hypothesis:** Instagram usage will spike during high-stress periods (e.g., exam preparations) due to its quick and low-effort engagement.  

**4. Time of Consumption** 

- **Research Question:** Are entertainment activities concentrated during evenings and weekends while working full-time, and more spread out as a university student?  
	- **Hypothesis:** During full-time work, the majority of entertainment consumption will occur in the evenings and weekends, while during university, it will be distributed more evenly throughout the week.  

**5. Stress Correlation**  

- **Research Question:** How does Instagram usage correlate with periods of high stress, such as work deadlines or exam preparations?  
	- **Hypothesis:** Instagram usage (e.g., time spent or engagement levels) will increase significantly during periods of high stress.  

- **Research Question:** Does a greater diversity of entertainment choices indicate lower stress levels?  
	- **Hypothesis:** During periods of lower stress, a greater variety of platforms and genres will be used compared to high-stress periods, which will show more repetitive patterns.  

## Data Source

Entertainment data will be exported directly from Letterboxd, TV Time, Goodreads, and Instagram as a personal data request.

The data will focus on the following variables:

- **Letterboxd:** Movie titles, genres, watch dates, ratings.  
- **TV Time:** Show titles, genres, watch dates, episode durations.  
- **Goodreads:** Book titles, genres, completion dates, ratings.  
- **Instagram:** Time spent, post engagement, content types (e.g., reels, photos, stories).  

## Planned Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize trends, platform usage, and preferences.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Investigate the hypotheses listed above using techniques such as correlation analysis and regression models.  
- **Machine Learning:** Potentially use clustering to group similar entertainment patterns or predictive models to analyze changes over time.  

## Expected Outcomes

- Insights into how time constraints and stress affect entertainment choices.  
- Identification of patterns in content consumption during different life stages.  
- Reflection on personal habits and potential suggestions for more balanced entertainment consumption.
